# Commit Message Guidelines

## Style
- Use American English.
- Use backticks everywhere for code entities, paths, dependencies, cli flags, config keys, and similar technical tokens.

## Format
```markdown
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<breaking changes>

<footer>
```

- `<type>`, `<scope>`, and `<subject>` are mandatory
- `<body>`, `<breaking changes>`, and `<footer>` are optional

## Header

### `type`
Pick the best match for the primary intent of the change:

1. `feat`: add a new user-facing capability
2. `fix`: correct broken/incorrect behavior
3. `refactor`: improve code/structure
4. `perf`: improve performance
5. `style`: change formatting, styling, or purely visual presentation
6. `chore`: perform maintenance, dependency, tooling, or housekeeping work
7. `build`: change build tooling, packaging, or bundling behavior
8. `test`: add or update tests
9. `ci`: change CI workflows or automation
10. `docs`: add or update documentation

### `scope`
Choose the narrowest stable area that best describes the change.

Prefer a feature or subsystem name.

### `subject`
The subject should be:
- imperative
- present-tense
- lowercase
- concise and specific
- free of a trailing period

Prefer the outcome over implementation trivia. Good subjects usually start with verbs like `add`, `fix`, `update`, `remove`, `refactor`, `rename`, `improve`, etc.

## Details
### `body`
Skip the body if the header is self-explanatory.

Add a body when:
- the reason for the change is not obvious from the subject
- the behavior change needs a little extra context
- the user supplied motivation worth preserving

### `BREAKING CHANGE`
If the change is breaking:
- add `!` before the colon in the header
- add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` section in the details

Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` only when the diff clearly introduces an incompatible API, config, CLI, output, or behavior change.

For multiple breaking changes, use bullet points after `BREAKING CHANGE:`.

### `footer`
Add a footer when the user asks to include issue/PR references.

Typical footer verbs:
- `Fixes #123`
- `Closes #123`
- `Refs #123`

## Commit Message Examples
```markdown
feat(playlist-sorting): auto-refresh grid on playlist rename

Monitor `browse/edit_playlist` requests and refresh the grid to reflect updated playlist names.
```

```markdown
fix(changelog-gen): use correct content for `BREAKING CHANGES` section

Previously, when a commit had a `breakingChanges` property, the changelog would incorrectly display the commit's `subject` in the `BREAKING CHANGES` section instead of the actual `breakingChanges` content.

Fixes #123
```

```markdown
test(cli): use `runCli` function instead of executing `dist/cli.js`

Remove the need for building the project before running tests.
```

```markdown
feat(config)!: add support for multiple profiles with CLI `--profile` flag

BREAKING CHANGE: Changed alias for `prerelease` option to `P` to reserve `p` for the new `--profile` option.

Closes #123
```

```markdown
refactor(config)!: simplify config by always reading current version from `package.json`

BREAKING CHANGE: The `packageFiles` option has been removed. The current version is now always read from `package.json`.
```

```markdown
refactor(changelog-gen)!: replace `stdout` and `outputFile` options with unified `output`

BREAKING CHANGE: The `stdout` and `outputFile` options have been removed from changelog configuration. Use the new `output` option with 'stdout' for console output or a file path string for file output.
